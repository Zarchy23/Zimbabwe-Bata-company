# Bata Zimbabwe Website

This repository contains a multi-page static website prototype for **Bata Zimbabwe**.
It includes a simple client-side e-commerce cart (localStorage), Chart.js visualizations, and placeholder images.

## Contents
- `index.html`, `products.html`, `about.html`, `store-locator.html`, `promotions.html`, `contact.html`
- `styles.css` - shared CSS
- `js/` - client-side scripts (cart, initialization)
- `images/` - placeholder images

## How to deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Upload these files to the repository root.
3. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, select Branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`.
4. Save and wait a minute; your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Notes
- The cart is client-side only (simulated). For real checkout you need a backend and payment integration.
- Replace placeholder images in `images/` with real product photos.
